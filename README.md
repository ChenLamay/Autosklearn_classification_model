# Protein Interaction Analysis

### Project Goal: Predicting Protein Variability

This project aims to forecast essential protein variability features using machine learning and protein-protein interaction data. The objective is to create a model that accurately predicts five key attributes characterizing protein variability, derived from various interaction characteristics such as averages, maximum values, standard deviations, percentiles of confidence levels, and the count of interacting proteins.

## Dataset Insight

The dataset provides a view of protein interactions, attributing 65 features to each protein entry. These features encapsulate different attributes of protein interactions, offering a diverse array of data points to aid in the development of the predictive model.

## Implementation Guidance

1. **Data Files:** 
   - `csv.train_features_protein`: Contains training examples.
   - `csv.train_labels_protein`: Provides labels for the training samples.
   - `csv.test_features_protein`: Comprises test samples for prediction purposes.
2. **Prediction Task:**
   - The project entails predicting specific labels for the test samples using a structured CSV format.
   - Evaluation of model performance based on the average AUC value for the predictions of the five target features.
3. **Model Development:**
   - Experimentation with various machine learning models to train and predict the protein features.
